## üîß Installation

Follow these steps to configure the Auto-GPT Email Plugin:

### 1. Follow Auto-GPT-Plugins Installation Instructions
Follow the instructions as per the [Auto-GPT-Plugins/README.md](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugins/blob/master/README.md)

### 2. Locate the `.env.template` file
Find the file named `.env.template` in the main `/Auto-GPT` folder.

### 3. Create and rename a copy of the file
Duplicate the `.env.template` file and rename the copy to `.env` inside the `/Auto-GPT` folder.

### 4. Edit the `.env` file
Open the `.env` file in a text editor. Note: Files starting with a dot might be hidden by your operating system.

### 5. Add email configuration settings
Append the following configuration settings to the end of the file:

```ini
################################################################################
### EMAIL (SMTP / IMAP)
################################################################################

EMAIL_ADDRESS=
EMAIL_PASSWORD=
EMAIL_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587
EMAIL_IMAP_SERVER=imap.gmail.com

# Optional Settings
EMAIL_MARK_AS_SEEN=False
EMAIL_SIGNATURE="This was sent by Auto-GPT"
EMAIL_DRAFT_MODE_WITH_FOLDER=[Gmail]/Drafts
```

1. **Email address and password:**
    - Set `EMAIL_ADDRESS` to your sender email address.
    - Set `EMAIL_PASSWORD` to your password. For Gmail, use an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords).

2. **Provider-specific settings:**
    - If not using Gmail, adjust `EMAIL_SMTP_HOST`, `EMAIL_IMAP_SERVER`, and `EMAIL_SMTP_PORT` according to your email provider's settings.

3. **Optional settings:**
    - `EMAIL_MARK_AS_SEEN`: By default, processed emails are not marked as `SEEN`. Set to `True` to change this.
