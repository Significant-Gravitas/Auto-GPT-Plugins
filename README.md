> ⚠️💀 **WARNING** 💀⚠️:
> Review the code of any plugin you use thoroughly, as plugins can execute any Python code, potentially leading to malicious activities, such as stealing your API keys.

## Installation

**_⚠️This is a work in progress⚠️_**

Follow these steps to configure the Auto-GPT Plugins:

1. **Install Auto-GPT**

   If you haven't already, create a folder `Significant-Gravitas` and clone the [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) repository into the folder. Follow the installation instructions provided by [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT).

1. **Clone the Auto-GPT-Plugins repository**

   Clone this repository into the `Significant-Gravitas` folder as well:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugins.git
   ```
   You should now have two folders in your `Significant-Gravitas` folder: `Auto-GPT` and `Auto-GPT-Plugins`.

1. **Install required dependencies**

   Navigate to the Auto-GPT-Plugins folder in your terminal and execute the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   - For Command Prompt:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   - For PowerShell:
   ```
   pip install -r .\requirements.txt
   ```

1. **Package the plugin as a Zip file**

   Execute the following command to compress the Auto-GPT-Plugins folder and place the archive into the `Auto-GPT/plugins` folder:

   - For Command Prompt:
   ```
   zip -ru ../Auto-GPT/plugins/Auto-GPT-Plugins.zip
   ```
   
   - For PowerShell:
   ```
   Compress-Archive -Path .\* -DestinationPath ..\Auto-GPT\plugins\Auto-GPT-Plugins.zip -Force
   ```

   Alternatively, you can manually zip the `Auto-GPT-Plugins` folder, rename it to Auto-GPT-Plugins.zip, and then paste the zip file into the `Auto-GPT/plugins/` directory.

## Configuration

For interactionless use, set `ALLOWLISTED_PLUGINS=example-plugin1,example-plugin2,etc` in your `.env` file.

## Making a plugin

Creating a plugin is a rewarding experience! You can choose between first-party or third-party plugins. First-party plugins are included in this repo and are installed by default along with other plugins when the plugin platform is installed. Third-party plugins need to be added individually. Use first-party plugins for plugins you expect others to use and want, and third-party for things specific to you.

### First Party How-To

1. Clone the plugins repo
1. Follow the structure of the other plugins, implementing the plugin interface as required
1. Write your tests
1. Add your name to the [codeowners](.github/CODEOWNERS) file
1. Add your plugin to the [Readme](README.md)
1. Make a PR back to this repo!

### Third Party How-To

1. Clone [the third party template](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugin-Template)
1. Follow the instructions in the [third party template readme](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugin-Template)
