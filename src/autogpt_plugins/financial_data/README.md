# Auto-GPT Financial Data Plugin

The Auto-GPT Financial Data Plugin is a powerful tool that fetches, processes, and analyzes financial data for a given company. The plugin makes use of the Yahoo Finance API, processing the fetched data, generating a detailed financial report which includes key stock data and recent news. Users can use the plugin to analyze financial data automatically using Auto-GPT, or manually generate a financial report by feeding the gathered data to ChatGPT.

## Features
Fetching Financial Data: The plugin fetches a comprehensive set of financial data for the given company, including its income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.

Stock Data Analysis: The plugin performs statistical analysis on the company's stock data, providing key metrics and insights.

News Data Extraction: The plugin fetches and processes the most recent news related to the given company.

Data Generation: The plugin writes all the gathered information to a file, which can be further used to analyze financial data using Auto-GPT or to manually generate a financial report by passing the data to ChatGPT.

## How to Use
When using the plugin, you can directly ask AutoGPT to generate the financial data for a specific company. For example, if you want to generate the financial data for Microsoft, you would phrase it as follows:
`"Generate financial data for Microsoft"`
Alternatively, you can specify the stock symbol of the company for more precise results. For example, for Apple Inc., which has the stock symbol "AAPL", you would phrase your command as follows:
`"Generate financial data for AAPL"`
Don't worry if you don't remember the stock symbol, though. If you specify the full name of the company, AutoGPT will generally be able to recognize it and retrieve the correct symbol for you.
