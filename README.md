## Making a plugin

Making a plugin is amazing! There's two routes to follow, first-party or third-party. First-party plugins are included in this repo and get included by default with all other plugins when the plugin platform is installed. Third-party plugins need to be added individually. Use first party plugins for plugins you expect others to use and want, and third party for things specifc to you. 

### First Party How-To
1. Clone the pluigins repo
1. Follow the structure of the other plugins, implementing the plugin interface as required
1. Write your tests
1. Make a PR back to this repo!

### Third Party How-To
1. Clone [the third party template](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugin-Template)
1. Follow the instructions in the [third party template readme](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugin-Template)

### Migrating Third Party to First Party
