# freddyaboulton/autogpt-gradio-tools ü§ù

A plugin giving AutoGPT access to [Gradio](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio) spaces running on
the [huggingface hub](https://huggingface.co/spaces) and elsewhere!

Integration powered by [gradio-tools](https://github.com/freddyaboulton/gradio-tools)

gradio-tools comes with a set of pre-built tools but it is easy to add new tools. 

All contributions to `gradio-tools` and this plugin are welcome!

## Features

Each tool specified via the env file will add a command that gives AutoGPT
the ability to call that gradio app programmatically and get its prediciton. 

For example, an LLM could use a Gradio tool to transcribe a voice recording it finds online and then summarize it for you. Or it could use a different Gradio tool to apply OCR to a document on your Google Drive and then answer questions about it.
