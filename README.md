# Auto-GPT-Plugins

> ‚ö†Ô∏èüíÄ **WARNING** üíÄ‚ö†Ô∏è:
> Always examine the code of any plugin you use thoroughly, as plugins can execute any Python code, leading to potential malicious activities such as stealing your API keys.

> ‚öôÔ∏è **WORK IN PROGRESS** ‚öôÔ∏è:
> The plugin API is still being refined. If you are developing a plugin, expect changes in the upcoming versions.

## New in Auto-GPT 0.4.1
- Unzipped plugins are now supported! You can now clone or download plugins directly from GitHub and place them in the `plugins` directory without zipping, as long as they are in the correct (NEW) format.
- Plugins settings have been moved out of the `.env` file to a new `plugins_config.yaml` file in the root directory of Auto-GPT.
- `ALLOWLISTED_PLUGINS` and `DENYLISTED_PLUGINS` `.env` settings are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
- Plugins must now be explicitly enabled in plugins. See the [installation](#installation) section for more details.
- The plugin format has changed. For now the old zip format is still supported, but will be removed in a future release. See the [plugin format](#plugin-format) section for more details.

### Note: The Auto-GPT-Plugins repo must still be Zipped

> The core Auto-GPT Plugins are still in the old format, and will need to be zipped as shown in the instructions below. **THEY WILL NOT WORK UNZIPPED**. This will be fixed in a future release.

## Installation

**_‚ö†Ô∏èThis is a work in progress‚ö†Ô∏è_**

Here are the steps to configure Auto-GPT Plugins. 

1. **Install Auto-GPT**

   If you haven't done so, follow the installation instructions given by [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) to install it.

1. **Download the plugins folder from the `root` of `Auto-GPT` directory**

    To download it directly from your Auto-GPT directory, you can run this command on Linux or MacOS:

    ```bash
    curl -L -o ./plugins/Auto-GPT-Plugins.zip https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugins/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
    ```

    Or in PowerShell:

    ```pwsh
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugins/archive/refs/heads/master.zip"     -OutFile "./plugins/Auto-GPT-Plugins.zip"
    ```

1. **Execute the dependency install script for plugins**

    This can be run via:

    Linux or MacOS:

    ```bash
    ./run.sh --install-plugin-deps
    ```

   Windows:

    ```pwsh
   .\run.bat --install-plugin-deps
    ```

    Or directly via the CLI:

    ```bash
    python -m autogpt --install-plugin-deps
    ````

1. **Enable the plugins** 

    To activate a plugin, the user should create or edit the `plugins_config.yaml` file located in the root directory of Auto-GPT. All plugin options can be configured in this file. 
    
    For example, if the `astro` plugin needs to be enabled, the following line should be added to the `plugins_config.yaml` file:
    ```yaml
    AutoGPTSpacePlugin:
        config: {}
        enabled: true
    ```

1. **Alernate option to enable the plugins** (May cease to function at any point as the .env support for plugins may change)
   
   In your .env file add the lines below. If your plugins_config.yaml does not exist it should generate correctly when you run Auto-GPT based on what you populate below.
   ```
   ################################################################################
   ### ALLOWLISTED PLUGINS
   ################################################################################

   #ALLOWLISTED_PLUGINS - Sets the listed plugins that are allowed (Example: plugin1,plugin2,plugin3)
   ALLOWLISTED_PLUGINS=AutoGPTReddit

   DENYLISTED_PLUGINS=AutoGPTBluesky,AutoGPTTelegram,AutoGPTEmailPlugin,AutoGPTNewsSearch,PlannerPlugin,AutoGPTSceneXPlugin,AutoGPTTwitter,AutoGPTWikipediaSearch,AutoGPTWolframAlphaSearch,AutoGPTSpacePlugin,AutoGPTBaiduSearch,AutoGPTBingSearch
   ```
   
## Plugins

There are two categories of plugins: **first party** and **third party**.

 **First-party plugins** are a curated list of widely-used plugins, and are included in this repo. They and are installed by default when the plugin platform is installed. See the [First Party Plugins](#first-party-plugins) section below for a comprehensive list.

 **Third-party plugins** need to be added individually. They may be useful for your specific needs. See the [Third Party Plugins](#third-party-plugins) section below for a short list of third-party plugins, and for information on how to add your plugin. Note: The Auto-GPT community has developed numerous third-party plugins and this list doesn't include them all. See the [Community-contributed plugins directory](#community-contributed-plugins-directory) section below for a more comprehensive list.

### Community contributed plugins directory

Community member and contributor, **[@dylanintech](https://github.com/dylanintech/)**, maintains a [**growing directory**](https://autoplugins.vercel.app/) of **Auto-GPT plugins and their contributors. To get your plugin listed in that directory, add your info to the `data` array in `plugins.tsx` of [his repo](https://github.com/dylanintech/autoplugins) and submit a PR.

## Configuration

Plugins must be enabled in `plugins_config.yaml`. 

If you still have `ALLOWLISTED_PLUGINS` and `DENYLISTED_PLUGINS` in your `.env` file, Auto-GPT will use them to create the `plugins_config.yaml` file the first time. 

This file contains a list of plugins to load. The format is as follows:

```yaml
plugin_a:
  config:
    api_key: my-api-key
  enabled: false
PluginB:
  config: {}
  enabled: true

```

The various sections are as follows:

- key: The name of the plugin. E.g. `plugin_a` or `PluginB`.

    This is used to load the plugin. It's format depends on whether the plugin is zipped or unzipped.
    
    **For zipped plugins**, the key must be the name of the plugin **class**. For example, the `weather` plugin in this repository would `WeatherPlugin`, and in the example above, `PluginB` is most likely a zipped plugin.

    **For unzipped plugins**, the key must be the name of the plugin **directory**. For example, in the example above, the `plugin_a` directory would be loaded as a plugin.

- config: The configuration for the plugin. 

    This is passed to the plugin when it is loaded. The format of this field depends on the plugin. This field is optional. Use `{}` if you do not need to pass any configuration to the plugin.

    Note that `plugins_config.yaml` file is only used by Auto-GPT to decide whether to load a plugin. For specific plugin settings, please refer to the documentation provided for each plugin. Plugin developers may still rely on`.env` for other plugin specific settings. We encourage developers to migrate their settings to the `config` field in the new `plugins_config.yaml` file.

- enabled: Determines whether the plugin is loaded. 

## Creating a Plugin

Creating a plugin is a rewarding experience! You can choose between first-party or third-party plugins. First-party plugins are included in this repo and are installed by default along with other plugins when the plugin platform is installed. Third-party plugins need to be added individually. Use first-party plugins for plugins you expect others to use and want, and third-party for things specific to you.

## Plugin Format

Plugins must follow a specific structure in order to be found and loaded successfully. The structure depends on whether a plugin is zipped or unzipped.

Zipped plugins must subclasses `AutoGPTPluginTemplate`(https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugin-Template), and implement all the methods defined in AutoGPTPluginTemplate.

Unzipped plugins can also subclass `AutoGPTPluginTemplate`, but it is not required. They can implement only the methods they need. However, the name of the plugin's directory is used to load the plugin, so it must be unique within AutoGPT's `plugins` directory.

### First Party Plugins How-To
